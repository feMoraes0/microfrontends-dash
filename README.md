# Microfrontends Dashboard

## Objective

Documents what was learned during the second project at the course Microfrontends with React: A Complete Developer's Guide by Stephen Grider at Udemy.

## Topics

- Zero coupling between child projects
  - no shared state, no cross imports
  - can share libraries through module federation
- Container should not assume that a child is using a specific framework.
- CSS should not affect other projects.
- Version Control:
  - Monorepo vs. separate
  - Not defined during the course, student choice.
- **Container should be able decide to always use the latest version or specific version.**
